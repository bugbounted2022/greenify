# auto-green

[![Build Status](https://github.com/justjavac/auto-green/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/justjavac/auto-green/actions )

Automatically keep GitHub commit status evergreen.

> a commit a day keeps your girlfriend away.

## Principle

Use the timed task function of GitHub Actions to automatically execute `git commit` at regular intervals, and the commit information is "a commit a day keeps your girlfriend away", inspired by the question of Zhihu [How to keep all green for 365 days on GitHub? kind of experience? ](https://www.zhihu.com/question/34043434/answer/57826281) An anonymous user's answer:

> It used to be all green for more than 200 days, but left out my girlfriend, and it has been green until now.

For the principle of Github Action, you can check the official document [Introduction to Github Action](https://docs.github.com/cn/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions)

## use

- Click the **Use this template** button in the upper right corner to copy this GitHub repository, **:warning: Do not fork, because the dynamics of the fork project will not make you green :warning:**
- Modify [Lines 7 and 8 of the ci.yml file](https://github.com/justjavac/auto-green/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L7-L8) to remove the preceding ` #` sign
- Modify [lines 19, 20 of the ci.yml file](https://github.com/justjavac/auto-green/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L19-L20) to your own GitHub Account and Nickname
- (Optional) You can do this by modifying [line 8 of the ci.yml file](https://github.com/justjavac/auto-green/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L8) Adjust frequency

The scheduled task syntax has 5 fields separated by spaces, each field representing a time unit.

````plain
┌────────────── minutes (0 - 59)
│ ┌────────────── Hours (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌────────────── Day (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌────────────── Month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
│ │ │ │ ┌────────────── Week of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)

The meaning of each time field:

|symbol | description | example |
| ----- | -----------| ------------------------------- ------------|
| `*` | any value | `* * * * *` every hour every minute of every day |
| `,` | value separator | `1,3,4,7 * * * *` hourly 1 3 4 7 minutes |
| `-` | range | `1-6 * * * *` 1-6 minutes of every hour |
| `/` | every | `*/15 * * * *` every 15 minutes |

**Note**: Due to the limitation of GitHub Actions, if set to `* * * * *`, the actual execution frequency is every 5 minutes.
